        <h3>June 28<sup>th</sup> 2022</h3>

        <ul>
            <li> NEW: <a href="" style="cursor: not-allowed;">Guides are here</a>! Some basic how-to's for adding in
                guns,
                ammos and explosions to the game
                <ul>
                    <li>That being said, since the game changes often, anything made using them might not be compatible
                        for long
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li> Fixed menus occaionally persisting when entering a level
                    <li> Fixed a bug where exiting a level would stop any performance monitoring
                    <li> Fixed a bug where partial reloads would still replenish a weapon's ammo if the weapon was
                        switched off of
                    <li> Fixed a bug where firing during a partial reload would fire two shots
                    <li> Fixed a bug where attempting to fire a burst weapon while it was reloading would cause the
                        weapon to fire after the weapon was done reloading, regardless of if the mouse button was still
                        held down
                    <li> Fixed explosions not deal max damage within their
                        <code>radii.damage.min</code>
                    <li> Fixed a bug where switching to a weapon without quickswitch would use the old weapon's switch
                        delay.
                    <li> Fixed a bug where the game would sometimes be limited to a portion of the screen
                    <li> Fixed a bug where a keybind would be triggered even if a modifier key was held (ex:
                        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> would switch to the user's secondary weapon)
                    <li> Fixed explosions ignoring a player's invulnerability
                    <li> Fixed casings not spawning at the correct position
                    <li> Fixed casings' perpendicular spawn offsets being ignored if the casing was spawned on reload
                    <li> When firing the last round in a weapon, the reload will now start after the weapon's firing
                        delay, as opposed to immediately
                    <li> Fixed being able to start a reload earlier than what a weapon's switch delay would allow by
                        pressing the reload key
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Settings
                <ul>
                    <li> Added settings to

                    <li> Fixed a bug where first-time users would have no scope preference chosed in "Bot 1v1"

                        the field) as opposed to whenever the user types something in the field.
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <li> Damage numbers now round to the nearest hundreth

                </ul>

                            <li>Fixed a bug where switching to a weapon without quickswitch would use the old weapon's

                            <li>Fixed a bug where the game would sometimes be limited to a portion of the screen
                            <li>Fixed a bug where a keybind would be triggered even if a modifier key was held (ex:

                                of twice.

                            <li>Casings now shrink in size as they despawn (as they do ingame), as opposed to fading
